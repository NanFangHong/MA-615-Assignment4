# 10.5 Exercises

library(tidyverse)
# 1. How can you tell if an object is a tibble? (Hint: try printing mtcars, which is a regular data frame).

data(mtcars)
as.tibble(mtcars) %>% is.tibble() # Use is.tibble() to check if it is a tibble. 

# 2. Compare and contrast the following operations on a data.frame and equivalent tibble. 
#   What is different? 
#   Why might the default data frame behaviours cause you frustration?
# 
df <- data.frame(abc = 1, xyz = "a")
df_tibble <- tibble::tibble(abc = 1, xyz = "a")

# df does partial matching
df$x
df_tibble$x # tibble doesn't
df[, "xyz"] # returns a factor
df_tibble[, "xyz"] # returns a data frame
# returns the same thing but xyz is a factor in the data farme and a char in the tibble
df[, c("abc", "xyz")]
df_tibble[, c("abc", "xyz")]



# 3. If you have the name of a variable stored in an object, e.g. var <- "mpg", how can you extract the reference variable from a tibble?

dftib <- tibble(
  +     x = runif(5),
  +     y = rnorm(5),
  +     var = c('mpg', 'mpg', 'jpg', 'abd', 'qwe'))

dplyr::filter(dftib, var == 'mpg')

# 4. Practice referring to non-syntactic names in the following data frame by:
#   
annoying <- tibble(
  `1` = 1:10,
  `2` = `1` * 2 + rnorm(length(`1`))
)
#   1) Extracting the variable called 1.
annoying$`1`

#   2) Plotting a scatterplot of 1 vs 2.
ggplot(annoying, aes(`1`, `2`)) + geom_point()

#   3) Creating a new column called 3 which is 2 divided by 1.
annoying <- mutate(annoying, `3` = `2` / `1`)

#   4) Renaming the columns to one, two and three.
# 
colnames(annoying) <- c('one', 'two', 'three')

# 5. What does tibble::enframe() do? When might you use it?

# It convert named vector to a tibble. I might use it when I need to do data manupulation involving a named vector.

# 6. What option controls how many additional column names are printed at the footer of a tibble?

# options(tibble.max_extra_cols = n)


# 12.6.1 Exercises
who
# 
# 1. In this case study I set na.rm = TRUE just to make it 
#easier to check that we had the correct values. Is this reasonable? 
# It is reasonable since the initial tibble has too many missing data.

# Think about how missing values are represented in this dataset. 
# Are there implicit missing values? 
# Whatâ€™s the difference between an NA and zero?
who %>% filter(is.na(new_sp_m014) == FALSE) %>% arrange(new_sp_m014)
who %>% filter(is.na(new_sp_m014) == FALSE) %>% arrange(desc(new_sp_m014))
# there is not other implicit missing values. 
# NA is missing value. zero is no case if not indicated. 

# 2. What happens if you neglect the mutate() step? (mutate(key = stringr::str_replace(key, "newrel", "new_rel")))
# If we neglect the mutate() step, then we can't split by '_' for some "newrel".

# 3. I claimed that iso2 and iso3 were redundant with country. Confirm this claim.
who %>% distinct(country) %>% count()
who %>% distinct(iso2) %>% count()
who %>% distinct(iso3) %>% count()
#the distinct elements have same number, so it is very very likely 

# 4. For each country, year, and sex compute the total number of cases of TB. Make an informative visualisation of the data.
who.tidy <- who %>% 
  gather(new_sp_m014:newrel_f65, key = "key", value = "cases", na.rm = TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(key = stringr::str_replace(key, "newrel", "new_rel")) %>% 
  separate(key, c("new", "type", "sexage"), sep = "_") %>% 
  select(-new, -iso2, -iso3) %>% 
  separate(sexage, c("sex", "age"), sep = 1)
who.tidy %>% count(country, year, type, sex)
